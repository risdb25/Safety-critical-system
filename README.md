# Safety-critical-system

This project demonstrates:

* ability to learn a new programming language quickly (Had never used Ada SPARK prior to undertaking this assignment)
* understanding of program flow control
* developing for safety-critical systems
* adherance to best programming practice

This project was developed as my submission for a module's coursework assignment during my undergraduate studies. The objective of the coursework was to develop a driver's assistance system for an automated vehicle. The had to prevent certain actions when they are unsafe, such as the driver being unable to start the car unless it is in the Parked gear; the speed limit must be obeyed at all times; the gearbox cannot go directly from Drive to Reverse; and so on. My task was to design a solution that ensured all the outlined conditions were guaranteed using formal verification techniques.
